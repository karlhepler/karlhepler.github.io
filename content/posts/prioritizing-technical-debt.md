## Hypothetical

Software engineering teams are not able to take advantage of the _typical_
approach to prioritizing technical debt, in which a predetermined percentage of
their overall capacity is "taken off the top" and reserved for non-functional
work.

In other words, 100% of each team's budgeted capacity for upcoming work has
been allocated for feature development with no room for anything else. In
addition to this, the work has already been planned, scoped, and started with
no buffer and no tolerance for missing deadlines.

All the while, the amount of technical debt is accumulating more and more with
each passing moment. Teams across the organization strongly believe that it is
critical to pay it down during this cycle, or they might not be able to produce
_anything_ during the next cycle. With leadership pressing forward with a blind
eye towards this issue, how can software engineering teams justify paying down
technical debt when they simply don't have the capacity to do so?
