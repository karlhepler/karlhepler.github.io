title: Hypothetical Haycorns
---

Hello, and welcome to my software engineering blog! Please join me as I explore
different hypothetical scenarios in software engineering, highlighting
relatable challenges often faced by engineers and teams. Guided by light
research, critical thinking, and first principles, I stumble upon solutions
that likely already exist.

Why re-invent the wheel? Because it's fun!
