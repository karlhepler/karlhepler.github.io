title: Hypothetical Haycorns
---

Hello, and welcome to my software engineering blog! Please join me as I explore
different hypothetical scenarios in software engineering, highlighting
relatable challenges often faced by engineers and teams. Guided by critical
thinking and first principles, I come up with solutions that probably
_"re-invent the wheel"_... but I don't care because it's fun.
